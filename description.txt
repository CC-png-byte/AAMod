The Ancients have Awakened. Chaos reigns, storms ravage, and reality tears at the seams!

**Don't forget to download Base Mod! It's required for this mod because I'm a shitty coder without it ;w; You can find it on the mod browser.**

**NOTE 1: This mod is still in beta. I'm still doing my best to iron out bugs and add content.**

**NOTE 2: Small worlds are heavilly discouraged with this mod. Things break because we have a lot of worldgen.**

This mod adds:

800+ Items, including EX items; powerful upgrades to previous weapons with a new twist to them!

100+ NPCs

21 Bosses (7 Pre-Hardmode, 4 Hardmode, and 5 Post-Moon Lord)

4 New Biomes.

-The World Chaoses: Alternatives to the World Evils. 

	The Inferno, a volcanic biome ravaged by dragons, with gear mainly focusing on raw defense.

	The Mire, a swampy biome infested by slithering creatures of the dark, with gear mainly focusing on sheer speed.

-The Void: Floating Islands at the top right of the world. Nothing is there, there is no reason to go there (Or is there?)

-The Terrarium: A crystal biosphere safe from the ever-corrupting world around you. Currently underdeveloped, but it has content post-plantera.

Cross-Mod content with GRealm and Thorium, with Mod of Redemption, Calamity, & Varia cross-mod content planned! (Thorium support being worked on. Currently only one healer weap)

Fargo's Mutant Mod support.

A unique soundtrack.
